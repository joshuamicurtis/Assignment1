My name is Joshua Curtis. I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I study history 
as an undergraduate at Oberlin College in Ohio. Since graduating from 
college I’ve held jobs in the education field and lived in a number of 
different places including South Korea, Mississippi, Arkansas, Portland 
and most recently New York. At the end of this summer I’ll be moving to 
Pittsburgh. I enjoy cooking, walking, hiking, and reading.

In the break between spring and winter terms, I'll be traveling to Spain 
to celebrate my girlfriend getting out of the Coast Guard. I'm also going
to take a road trip at the end of summer term to bring my truck from 
Portland to Pittsburgh.
