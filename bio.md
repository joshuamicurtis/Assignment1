My name is Joshua Curtis. I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I study history 
as an undergraduate at Oberlin College in Ohio. Since graduating from 
college I’ve held jobs in the education field and lived in a number of 
different places including South Korea, Mississippi, Arkansas, Portland 
and most recently New York. At the end of this summer I’ll be moving to 
Pittsburgh. I enjoy cooking, walking, hiking, and reading.

Programming Background

I started taking Computer Information classes at Portland Community
College in 2012, to gains skills for the job I had at the time and to 
improve my future job prospects. I enjoyed those courses, and took them
for a couple years, adding in some Computer Science courses as well. Last
fall I realized that the PCC classes were not as challenging as I would 
have liked them to be so I applied to OSU's eCampus Computer Science
program, where I began taking classes last term.
