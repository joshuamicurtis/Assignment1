My name is Joshua Curtis. I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I study history 
as an undergraduate at Oberlin College in Ohio. Since graduating from 
college I’ve held jobs in the education field and lived in a number of 
different places including South Korea, Mississippi, Arkansas, Portland 
and most recently New York. At the end of this summer I’ll be moving to 
Pittsburgh. I enjoy cooking, walking, hiking, and reading.

In the break between spring and winter terms, I'll be traveling to Spain 
to celebrate my girlfriend getting out of the Coast Guard. I'm also going
to take a road trip at the end of summer term to bring my truck from 
Portland to Pittsburgh.

I would eventually like to move back to the west coast, or at least 
somewhere warmer than the midwest or northeast.

Programming Background

I started taking Computer Information classes at Portland Community
College in 2012, to gains skills for the job I had at the time and to 
improve my future job prospects. I enjoyed those courses, and took them
for a couple years, adding in some Computer Science courses as well. Last
fall I realized that the PCC classes were not as challenging as I would 
have liked them to be so I applied to OSU's eCampus Computer Science
program, where I began taking classes last term.

I have experience with C++ from CS 161 and CS 162. I have experience with
 SQL from some database classes from PCC. I have some experience with HTML
, CSS, and JavaScript, both from class work and working on some websites 
for friends and some organizations I’ve been involved with. I have 
experience with MASM from CS 271.

I was born on mars. My parents are Wizards. After a brief minor league 
baseball career I became a wizard.
