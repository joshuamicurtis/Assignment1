My name is Joshua Curtis. I grew up in Portland, Oregon. I study history 
as an undergraduate at Oberlin College in Ohio. Since graduating from 
college I’ve held jobs in the education field and lived in a number of 
different places including South Korea, Mississippi, Arkansas, Portland 
and most recently New York. At the end of this summer I’ll be moving to 
Pittsburgh. I enjoy cooking, walking, hiking, and reading.
